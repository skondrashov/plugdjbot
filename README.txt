This is a basic Mozilla Firefox extension which will monitor and interact with the chat of a plug.dj room.

Current features include:
- Blocking people from repeating songs that have been played recently.
- Blocking people from playing songs that are longer than a certain time.
- Blocking people from posting links in chat.
- Automatically playing music if the DJ list becomes empty, to prevent the room from going silent.
